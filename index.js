//javascript is all about behavior
//all statements in js has to be terminated with a (;)
//naming conventions, they cannot be reserved keywords such as let, if, else, var, const etc. 
//should be meaningful
//cannot start with a number
//cannot contain multiple words, nor hyphens. Just use camelCase
//definitely case sensitive

//const means constant, as in it will remain the same instead of declaring it as let
// const interestRate = 0.3;
// console.log(interestRate);

//they are all variables, hence declared with let instead of const
let name = 'Kamrul'; //String Literal
let age = 23; // Number Literal
let isApproved = true; // boolean Literal
let firstName = undefined; // undefined
let selectedColor = null; //null

console.log(name);
